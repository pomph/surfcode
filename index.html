      <p>
        As in many other areas of life, in surfing there are certain unwritten rules independent of these official regulations, such as the issue of climbing the swells on the right side to avoid getting in the way if another user wants to go faster. 
      </p>

      <p>
        These rules are known as 'The Code of Ethics of Surfing' or 'The Surfer's Code', which is respected by most surfers, especially by the most experienced and lovers of this great sport. Beginners should learn these rules if they want to start out properly in surfing.

      <p>Whoever has been waiting for the longest has priority in the next wave. In general, the surfer who is paddling closer to the peak has a greater right to catch the wave: once it is taken, it is his and only his. Wait your turn, there are more waves!</p>

        If you paddle up to a wave and you can't catch it, don't pretend to go searching for the next one: you had your chance and you lost it. Now you must wait your turn and let some waves go by.

      When a surfer is running from your inside, you have the right to follow. This may seem unfair, especially if you didn't wait for your turn. However, there are more experienced and risky surfers, with more knowledge of the beach and its waves, who know where and when to stand. Beginners or less experienced, who do not know the waves of the beach so well, will wait for them further down. In any case, each of the groups must alternate to take the waves, thus both getting to enjoy this advantageous place.
      <code
        >function surfer(yourName) { alert("Aloha " + yourName); }
        surfer("Friend");

    <header>Don't take another surfer's wave</header>
    <p>
      It's dangerous for there to be more than one surfer on a wave. When you paddle a wave, look inside before taking it, if someone caught it before you: Do not take it! 
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you ride a wave and you realize someone was coming across it, get out as soon as possible. Taking some else's wave is surely the biggest mistake in Surfing. Never do it!

    <header>Do not wriggle</header>
    <article>
      Known as 'wriggling', this is the action of rowing towards the peak and passing in front of other surfers who are waiting to take the wave, don't do it. Apply rule number 1: Wait your turn.
      <p>
        For example, <code>var surfer = 42.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
        below.

  <section class="main-section" id="Share_waves_that_break_on_both_sides">
    <header>Share waves that break on both sides</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        If you meet another surfer who is paddling towards a wave that will break on both sides, try to share it. One can go to the left and the other to the right. You can tell the surfer you're closer to, so you both can take advantage of the wave.
      </p>

      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code
        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code

        Even if the other surfers don't have as much experience as you, the good waves come to you by chance, you are the best paddler or you're a local surfer, try not to catch all the waves and leave some for the rest of the surfers who have also come to surf.

      <p>
        When entering the water, if you see that you're going to bump into a surfer who is riding a wave, don't go to the unbroken part of the wave because you will cross in his path. Paddle from behind and grab the wave: it will take you longer but it is safer. Leave the face of the wave for the surfer who is riding it.

      <p>Even if you have the priority when you ride a wave and see that there's a risk of hitting another surfer, avoid it at all costs, even if you have to get out of the wave. Otherwise, a possibly serious accident could occur.:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Five examples of abuse:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cutting in. Moving across a surfer already on the wave.</li>
            <li>
              Line up. Jumping your place in an established line up.
            </li>
            <li>Not helping kooks. We should all be helping out those trying to learn, not putting them down.</li>
            <li>Honesty. Not lying about conditions or disguising hazards.</li>
            <li>Equipment. Offer advice to the less experienced about gear choices, don't stay silent.</li>
           
          </ul>

    <article>
     In Surfing there are no differences. Don't judge anyone because of their sex, appearance, skin color, race, a method of paddling or dress; none of that matters in surfing. All surfers deserve your respect. 

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      Remember that Duke Kahanamoku, the legend of Hawaiian surfing, recognized for modernizing this water sport, chose a woman as his first disciple.

    <article>
      <p>
      Even if another surfer has gotten into your wave, never use violence and trust in the power of the word. Remember that you surf for fun and enjoyment. Explain what he did; maybe he ignored a rule. And if he persists in his attitude, look for another place to surf and don't waste your time.

      <p>
      If you're just starting in extreme surfing conditions, don't get into them before you're ready, for your good and that of all the surfers. Do not go to a very busy surfing spot, but take a class in a surf camp or surf school, practicing on the beach, first, and away from bathers. And if you are an experienced surfer don't put the less experienced at risk, performing dangerous maneuvers.
